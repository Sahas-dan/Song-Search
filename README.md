# Song-Search
This project was done as a group project and it allows uers to find the titles, performing artists, and publication years for songs by searching for individual words in song titles. A Hash Table was used to associate individual words from the titles of songs (keys) with lists of songs that contain that word in their title (values). Users might also use this application as kind of trivia game by searching for years or artists associated with a particular title word, and then competing to see who can match those years or artists with the full titles of their respective songs.
